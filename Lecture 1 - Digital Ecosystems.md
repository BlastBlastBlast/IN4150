>**Ecosystems are networks (constellations) of multiple actors involved in value exchange and creation.**
> - **Digital ecosystems** = interconnected networks of actors (firms, users, platforms, etc.) exchanging value and co-creating through digital interactions.
	- These ecosystems rely on **complex relationships** beyond single-industry boundaries.

### Android Ecosystem

### 1. **Diversity of Participants**:
- Google (platform owner)
- Developers & development orgs
- OEMs (device manufacturers)
- Users / Reviewers
- Third-party providers (ads, analytics, payments)
### 2. **Interdependent Roles**:
- **Google** manages Play Store, policies, resources
- **Developers** build apps, follow rules, update & support
- **OEMs** customize OS, pre-install apps, support hardware
- **Users** download apps, review, influence rankings
- **3rd Parties** offer tools & services (e.g., UI libs, QA tools)
### 3. **Value Creation & Exchange**:
- **Monetary**: revenue from apps, hardware, ads
- **Non-monetary**: services, data, personalization
- Platform enables innovation, interaction, and profit
### 4. **Adaptability & Evolution**:
- Mobile tech changes
- Security threats
- Regulatory shifts (e.g., GDPR)
- Market competition
- Privacy, transparency, and developer education

## Summary: Ecosystem Characteristics
(from Thomas & Autio, 2020)
1. **Participant heterogeneity**
2. **Interdependence** (non-contractual)
3. **Ecosystem outputs**
4. **Adaptability & evolution**


## Modularity
> **Definition** (Baldwin & Clark, 1997):  
> Building complex systems from **independent but interoperable modules**
### ðŸ’» Historical Example:
- **Old mainframes** (e.g., UNIVAC, IBM 700): rigid, incompatible systems
- **IBM System/360** (1960s):
    - Unified architecture
    - Interoperable models
    - Opened to 3rd party module development
    - Became standard and highly successful

---
### Modularity in Practice:
- **Visible Design Rules**:
    1. **Architecture**: system blueprint (what modules exist)
    2. **Interfaces**: how modules connect (e.g., APIs)
    3. **Standards**: testing, measuring performance
- **Hidden Parameters**:
    - Allow internal innovation in modules
    - Donâ€™t disrupt system as a whole

---
## ðŸ§© Modularity in Digital Ecosystems
### 1. **Platform Architecture**:
- Modular software design = flexibility, upgradability, scalability
### 2. **Ecosystem Design**:
- Developers create add-ons via APIs
- Allows **customized extensions** (e.g., niche apps)
### ðŸŒŸ Outcomes:
- **Innovation** (e.g., constant app evolution)
- **Scalability** (e.g., Android across devices)
- **Resilience** (one module failure â‰  ecosystem failure)

## ðŸ”¬ Ecosystem Streams in Research

|Ecosystem Type|Focus|
|---|---|
|**Business**|Firm and environment|
|**Innovation**|Specific value propositions or new tech|
|**Platform**|Technological bases and the actors surrounding them|

_(Shipilov & Gawer, 2020)_

## ðŸ”— Platforms vs. Ecosystems

|Platform Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**One-sided**|Single user group (e.g., early Facebook)|
|**Multi-sided**|Several groups (e.g., users + advertisers)|
|**Hybrid**|Merged functions (e.g., devs, users, business)|
|**Ecosystem**|Complex, evolving networks with distributed control|

---
## ðŸ“Œ Final Summary
- Digital ecosystems = **dynamic constellations** of interdependent actors
- Defined by **diversity, modularity, value exchange**, and **evolution**
- Platforms are often part of ecosystems, but ecosystems go **beyond** platforms
- Modularity is a **core enabler** of scalability, innovation, and resilience
