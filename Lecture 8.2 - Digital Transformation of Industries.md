## üß≠ From IS to Ecosystems

### Traditional Approach:
- Focus on **individual systems**
- Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Organizational change

### Today‚Äôs Reality:
- Focus on **ecosystems and infrastructures**
- Involves **multiple systems and actors** (e.g., HS√ò: 5,700 solutions)
- **Continuous change**: tech + organization
- Shift from **organizational level** to **industry level**
- **Twin Transition**: Technology and organizational change shape each other

## üß¨ Variety Across Industries

### Depends on:
- Material vs. Information (atoms vs. Bits)
- Production complexity
- Nature of products/services

### Examples:
| Industry Type         | Characteristics |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Bits (media, finance) | High info, fast-changing |
| Info-intensive (aviation, health) | Complex services + tech |
| Low-complexity (e.g., restaurants) | Less integration, simpler processes |

---

## üéØ Case: Programmatic Advertising
- Massive growth in **AdTech** companies
- Platforms like Ad Exchanges, DSPs, social media, etc.
- Complex, **asymmetric production networks**

---

## üóûÔ∏è Media Industry Transformation

### Phases:
1. **Independent production**: Journalists, typewriters, press
2. **Digitization of editing/printing**
3. **Online publishing**: Multimedia, shared services, cloud

### Consequences:
- Centralization and consolidation
- Emergence of **asymmetric networks**
- New **gatekeepers**: Social media, Google

---

## üè¶ Banking and Finance

### Digitalization Success:
- Shared infrastructure (SWIFT, BankAxept, Vipps)
- High standardization and homogeneity
- Innovation: Derivatives, structured finance, Bitcoin?

### Observations:
- **Joint IT ownership** enabled success
- Finance as **digital-native sector**

## ‚úàÔ∏è Aviation: A Digital Ecosystem Pioneer

### Key Milestones:
- 1963/64: **SABER system** (American Airlines + IBM)
- 1975: Failed JIRS project ‚Üí open GDS systems
- 1980 s-90 s: Growth, globalization, new services (yield management, alliances)
- 2000 s: GDSs = **architectural control points**
- 2010 s: Bypass attempts via internet + direct booking

### Analysis:
- Booking = **information-intensive**
- Emerged as **platform ecosystems**
- Transformation driven by **network effects**
- Cycles of **stabilization ‚Üî destabilization**

## üè• Health Care Industry Transformation

### Evolution:
- From ‚Äúcar repair shop‚Äù ‚Üí **chronic care** + complex services
- Tech: **More devices**, data, and digital tools
- Structure: **Hospitals as enterprises**, tighter **primary-secondary care** links
- National digital coordination: ex. **Akson**

### Major Projects:
1. **Digital Renewal (2013‚Äì2018)**: NOK 7 B for infrastructure consolidation
2. **Digital Home Monitoring**: GP and hospital integration
3. **Specialized Services**: Velferdsteknologisk Knutepunkt, surgical technologies

### Example: **TAVI Surgery**
- TAVR introduced 2002, CE-marked in 2007
- Highly tech-dependent process with:
  - Digital imaging
  - PACS, EPR, advanced instruments
  - Multinational coordination

## üß† Digital Innovation & Industry Transformation

### Core Concepts:
- **Mutual shaping**: Tech ‚Üî Org structures
- Role of **dominant actors** (Google, Facebook, Alibaba)
- Emergence of **architectural control points**
- Risks: Bottlenecks, **reverse salients**
- **Governance, regulation**, and systemic design critical
