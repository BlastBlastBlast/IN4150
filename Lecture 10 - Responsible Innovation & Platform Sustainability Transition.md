**Lecturer: Raissa Pershina — Fall 2024**

## 🧠 What Is Innovation?

Innovation refers to the **implementation of new or significantly improved**:
- Products (goods/services)
- Processes
- Business models
- Organizational methods  
*(OECD, 2005)*

### Examples:
- **Nespresso** → Technology + business model
- **Facebook** → Digital platform, new form of communication
- **Amazon Prime** → Service innovation

> ⚠️ These innovations were **business successes**, but also created **ethical, environmental, and societal concerns**.

## ❓ What Is Responsible Innovation (RI)?

> “Responsible innovation means taking care of the future through **collective stewardship** of science and innovation in the present.”  
— *Stilgoe et al., 2013*

### 🔍 Core Questions:
- Who is responsible if things go wrong?
- What are the alternatives?
- How will risks and benefits be distributed?
- How do we know we are right?

## 🌱 The 4 Core Principles of RI  
*(Stilgoe et al., 2013)*

1. **Anticipation** – Think through plausible futures and outcomes.
2. **Reflexivity** – Reflect on underlying assumptions, values, and interests.
3. **Inclusion** – Involve stakeholders in the innovation process.
4. **Responsiveness** – Adjust innovation direction in response to feedback and context.

## ❗ Why Is RI Difficult for Organizations?

### I. Contradictory Stakeholder Agendas  
E.g. Nespresso:
- **Consumers** want convenience.
- **Shareholders** want profit.
- **Environmental groups** want sustainability.

### II. Changing Social Values & Laws  
- What was once acceptable (e.g., smoking) is now unethical.

### III. Converging Technologies  
- Emerging technologies are **hard to predict or govern**.

### IV. **Collingridge’s Dilemma**  
- Early-stage tech is **easy to change** but **poorly understood**.
- Late-stage tech is **better understood** but **hard to change**.

### V. Moral Overload  
Too many ethical demands + limited resources = paralysis or compromise.

## 🛠️ RI Tools & Frameworks

### Value Mapping Tool *(Bocken et al., 2013)*

| Stakeholder Group | Current Value | Negative Impact | Missed Opportunities | New Value Ideas |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|

### Circular Innovation Models  
- Emphasize iterative design, feedback loops, stakeholder co-creation.  
- Fit better with RI than linear innovation models.

## 💡 Airbnb Case Study (Simplified Value Mapping)

| Stakeholder        | Current Value                             | Negative Impact                                                 | Improvements                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Guests**         | Authentic stays, low prices               | Safety issues, discrimination, poor regulation                  | Rating transparency, support teams, ID verification           |
| **Hosts**          | Extra income, flexibility                 | Property damage, unstable income                                | Host insurance, guaranteed payments                          |
| **Communities**    | Tourism revenue                           | Housing shortages, noise, gentrification                        | Limit short-term rentals, community funds                    |
| **Environment**    | Decentralized stays (less impact?)        | Increased carbon footprint due to travel                        | Promote green stays, eco filters                             |

## 📦 Responsible Platform Design  
Examples:
- **Food delivery apps** → Cutlery opt-out, shared delivery times
- **Nespresso** → Coffee pod recycling
- **Grocery apps** → Delivery to neighbors at the same time

> 🧠 **Who bears the burden?** Often customers are responsible for sustainable choices. Should organizations take the lead instead?

---

## 🔍 Big Data Analytics and Technology (BDAT)

> BDAT = Holistic approach to collecting, managing, analyzing data for **actionable insights**.

### Applications Across Functions:
- Strategy
- Product dev
- CRM
- Marketing
- Operations
- Financial & risk management
- Workforce planning

---

## 🛒 Online Food Delivery Case: Sustainability Gaps

**Platforms**: Deliveroo, Postmates, UberEats

### Major Challenges:
- **Packaging waste** (36% of global plastic waste from packaging)
- **Carbon emissions**
- **Food waste**

### Digital Ecosystem:
- Restaurants
- Couriers
- Customers
- External data providers (weather, traffic, etc.)
- Social media inputs

## 🔁 Circular Participation & Sustainable Capabilities

**Circular participation**:  
Mutual sharing of data and acting on insights across all ecosystem participants.

**Sustainable capability** =  
Ability to orchestrate resources toward achieving sustainability goals  
*(Singh & El-Kassar, 2019)*

---

## 🧭 Guidelines for Implementing RI  
*(Jarmai et al., 2020)*

1. Understand RI principles and relevance.
2. Reflect on expected benefits of RI.
3. Secure commitment from leadership and staff.
4. Create an action plan.
5. Stay focused on RI objectives.
6. Re-evaluate and adapt regularly.

## 📌 Summary

- Innovation ≠ always responsible.
- RI aims to **anticipate, include, reflect**, and **respond**.
- Adoption is difficult due to complexity, change, and lack of consensus.
- Tools like **Value Mapping**, **BDAT**, and **Circular Innovation Models** support RI.
- **Platforms and ecosystems must take more responsibility**, not just offload it to users.

> “Responsibility is not optional in innovation—it’s essential for long-term success.”
