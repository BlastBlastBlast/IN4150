---
## 🎯 Agenda
- The story of **Wikipedia** and the **Wikimedia** movement
- Governance in **open ecosystems**
- Challenges & opportunities in **global digital platform ecosystems**

---

## 🧠 Course Learning Goals
- Analyze and evaluate **digital ecosystems**
- Reflect critically on **socially relevant challenges** with global platforms

---

## 📖 The Birth of Wikipedia

### From Books to Wikis
- Encyclopedic knowledge used to be confined to books
- Challenges:
  - Accessibility
  - Bias: Who decides what’s “encyclopedic”?

### Key Innovators
- **Ward Cunningham**: Invented wiki tech (collaborative editing)
- **Jimmy Wales & Larry Sanger**: Combined wiki with idea of open encyclopedia → *Wikipedia (2001)*

---

## 🌐 Wikipedia & the Wikimedia Ecosystem

### Wikipedia
- The **encyclopedia**
- Exists in **independent language versions**, each with its own **community** and **governance**

### Wikimedia
- The **ecosystem**
- Includes 13 sibling platforms (e.g., **Wikidata**, **Commons**)
- Managed by the **Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)**
- Supported by:
  - Donations
  - Endowment fund
  - Wikimedia Enterprise
- **Value creation**: Done by **volunteers** (280,000+)

---

## 🌱 What is an Open Ecosystem?

- **Open**: Anyone can participate
- Relies on volunteers
- **Governed** by interactions and architecture, not hierarchy

---

## 🧭 Governance in Open Ecosystems

### What is Governance?
> A complex framework of rules, functions, and power dynamics that shapes behavior, decision-making, and resource allocation in groups.

### Wikipedia’s Governance Challenge:
- How to coordinate **280,000 volunteers**?

---

## 📊 Governance in Online Social Production  
*(Aaltonen & Lanzara, 2001–2009)*

### Research Question:
> How does **collective governance capability** emerge and evolve?

### Method:
- Descriptive stats from 350 M edits (2001–2010)
- Narrative based on 3 development phases

---

## 🔁 Three Governance Phases

1. **Quantity over Quality** (Early stage)
   - “Ignore all rules”
   - Focus on contribution
   - Routines: writing, reverting, discussion

2. **Sharpening Routines** (Rapid growth)
   - Avoid editing wars
   - Featured articles to boost quality

3. **Maintenance & Quality Control** (Stabilization)
   - **Flagged revisions**
   - **Bots** for automation

---

## 🔍 Governance Through Interaction

- Rules and norms emerged from **user interaction**
- Governance is:
  - Embedded in **platform architecture**
  - Driven by **volunteer routines**
  - Dependent on sustained community effort

---

## 🚧 What’s Missing on Wikipedia?

- **Only ~20%** of biographies are about **women**
- **Geographic imbalance** (e.g., more articles on Paris than Africa)
- **Colonial bias** in descriptions of Indigenous cultures
- **Oral knowledge** not easily integrated

---

## ❓ Who Decides What’s Encyclopedic?

- How to encourage contributions in **missing languages and topics**?
- How to support **knowledge equity**?

---

## 🌻 Governance as Gardening (Poetic Analogy)
> Like a garden, an ecosystem requires **nurturing, patience, and respect**  
> We can till, water, remove weeds—but we can’t force it to grow

---

## 🧩 Two Types of Governance

### 1. Content Governance
- Happens **on-platform**
- Rules for creating and moderating content
- May vary across language communities

### 2. Contributor Governance
- Happens **off-platform**
- Includes:
  - Events
  - Courses
  - Tech development
  - Supporting new communities

---

## 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏿 Inclusive Participation

> What **enables or limits** participation of underrepresented groups?

### Example:
- **Wayuu & Dagbani Wikimedians**
  - Adapting practices to **local culture** can encourage inclusion
  - Some embedded routines **inhibit** new contributors unnecessarily

---

## 🌍 Transnational Communities of Practice

### Research Question:
> How do global digital communities scale and address grand challenges?

### Example:
- Three gender gap initiatives:
  - Same goal, different governance strategies
  - All succeeded in **different ways**

### Insight:
- Different communities need **different approaches**
- No “one-size-fits-all” governance model

---

## 🧠 Reflection Questions

- What is Wikipedia to **new generations** who never used physical encyclopedias?
- How will Wikipedia evolve with the **global expansion** of its communities?
- What is the role of Wikipedia in the **age of AI**?

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- An ecosystem = network of platforms, contributors, and governance
- Open ecosystems evolve **organically** through practice and need
- **Governance** is both relational and collaborative
- The structure must **adapt** to support diversity and inclusion

## 📅 Coming Up:
**Seminar on Friday – to be continued!**

Thank you!
