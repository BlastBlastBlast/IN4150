## üåç Platforms & Innovation

### Creative Destruction (Schumpeter, 1942)
- Innovation is a process of **creative destruction**: new industries arise by disrupting old ones.
- Entrepreneurs drive this transformation.
- Innovation studies are rooted in this principle.

## üöÄ Examples of Disruptive Platforms
| Industry       | Platform Example | Disruption |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Transportation | Uber, Lyft        | Ride-hailing over taxis |
| Hospitality    | Airbnb            | P 2 P accommodation |
| Retail         | Amazon            | Online shopping |
| Entertainment  | Spotify, Apple Music | Music streaming |
| Finance        | LendingClub, Prosper | P 2 P lending over banks |

---

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenges of New Ventures
- Viable idea and vision
- Funding
- Team and partnerships
- Resources (facilities, tools)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Designing a Platform

### Why it's hard:
- Platforms are **complex**, **multisided**, and **non-linear**.
- Traditional business (pipeline) logic doesn‚Äôt apply.

---

## üß© Start with the Core Interaction

**Core Interaction = Participants + Value Unit + Filter**

### Example: Airbnb
- **Participants**: Hosts (producers), Guests (consumers)
- **Value Unit**: Property listing
- **Exchange**: Earnings ‚Üî Lodging
- **Filter**: Search, location, dates

---

## üë´ Participants/Sides

- **Producers**: Create value (e.g., content, services)
- **Consumers**: Use the value
- Role swapping is ideal: e.g., Airbnb users can be both hosts and guests

---

## üíé Value Unit
- The **information** that lets users evaluate the offer.
- **Examples**:
  - **eBay**: Listings
  - **Kickstarter**: Project descriptions
  - **Uber**: Available drivers
  - **YouTube**: Videos
- Must be high quality and relevant to succeed

---

## üéØ Filters
- Determine which value units users see
- Can be:
  - **Weak**: Headings (e.g., newspaper sections)
  - **Strong**: Algorithms (e.g., search, location, behavior, social signals)

---

## üß† Case Study Prompts

For each case, answer:
- Core interaction?
- What value is exchanged?
- Role swapping?
- Value units?
- Filters?

**Cases**: Uber, Facebook, Foodora, Yelp, OnlyFans, Quora

---

## üîÅ Core Interaction is Key

- Build features around enhancing the **core interaction**
- Can add new interactions later:
  - **Planned** (e.g., Uber ‚Üí UberPool)
  - **Emergent** (e.g., LinkedIn ‚Üí Recruiting/Ads)

**Track user behavior** ‚Üí detect new interaction opportunities.

## üìä Driving Growth: Pull, Match, Facilitate (Cusumano et al., 2019)

### 1. Pull
- Attract and retain users
- Solve the **chicken-or-egg problem**
  - Not enough users on one side ‚Üí other side doesn‚Äôt join
  - Use standalone value or incentives

### 2. Match
- Match supply and demand effectively
- Use user data and value unit data

### 3. Facilitate
- Provide tools & infrastructure
- Governance: rules, quality assurance, rewards/penalties

---

## üê£ Solving the Chicken-or-Egg Problem

**Strategies:**

- **OpenTable**:
  - Gave restaurants free table management software
  - Later onboarded diners

- **Airbnb**:
  - Scraped Craigslist for property listings
  - Offered free photography for hosts

- **Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn**:
  - Built same-side network (users)
  - Then added advertisers

- **Subsidizing**: Free usage, content creation, delivery
  - Risky, requires:
    - Big investment
    - Barriers to entry
    - Chance at winner-take-all

---

## üîÑ Feedback Loops

### Single-user Loop
- Personalized algorithm ‚Üí better content ‚Üí more engagement

### Multi-user Loop
- Creator posts ‚Üí user reacts ‚Üí creator is rewarded ‚Üí cycle continues

---

## üß∞ Facilitation Tools

- Image tools (Instagram)
- Editing tools (Vimeo)
- Quality assurance
- Payment integration
- Search, location services

---

## üîó Matching

- Use user & product data to match:
  - Preferences, demographics, history
- Encourage data sharing:
  - **Gamification**: e.g., LinkedIn profile progress

---

## üîê Trust in Platforms

> ‚ÄúTrust is hard to get, easy to lose.‚Äù

### Types:
- **Trust-in-provider/consumer** (personalized)
- **Trust-in-platform**
- **Generalized trust** (less studied)

---

## üîë Trust Mechanisms (Teubner & Dann, 2018)

| Category             | Examples |
|----------------------|----------|
| **Transaction-based**| Ratings, reviews |
| **Expressive profiles**| Full name, photo |
| **Implicit signals** | Badges, duration |
| **Identity verification**| Email, phone, social media |
| **Risk management** | Escrow, insurance |

### Escrow Example:
- **Alipay**: Holds funds until buyer confirms delivery
- **Finn. No**: ‚ÄúPengene holdes hos FINN til varen er levert‚Äù

---

## üìê The Platform Canvas (Allwein et al., 2021)

### Building Blocks:

1. **Producer & Consumer Segments**
   - Who are you connecting?
   - What roles do they play?

2. **Value Proposition**
   - What problem are you solving for each group?

3. **Interaction**
   - What are the core and additional interactions?

4. **Facilitation**
   - Technology (search, filters)
   - Governance (rules, trust, disintermediation)

5. **Substitutes**
   - Alternatives to your platform (Finn. No, direct contact)

6. **Stimuli**
   - Strategies to solve chicken-or-egg problem

7. **Monetization**
   - Revenue strategies: subscriptions, ads, extra services

8. **Cost Model**
   - Infrastructure, support, development, delivery

9. **Metrics**
   - User growth, transactions, reviews, revenue

## üßæ Airbnb Platform Canvas Example

| Element | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Segments | Hosts (producers), Renters (consumers) |
| Value | Lodging access ‚Üî Earnings |

## üß† Final Takeaways

- Start with **core interaction**
- Solve **chicken-or-egg** strategically
- Build **trust**
- Encourage **repeat use** through feedback loops
- Use **data** to match, facilitate, and expand
- **Design** for growth, but adapt to real user behavior
