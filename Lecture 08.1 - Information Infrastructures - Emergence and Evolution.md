## 🔍 Trends in Digital Infrastructure

- **Rapid increase in solutions**:
  - Aker BP: 700
  - Nordea: 2000
  - Equinor: 3000
  - Helse Sør-Øst: 5000+

- **Installed Base Evolution**:
  - IS development resembles **geology**: digital "sand" becomes "rock" or “concrete” over time.
  - Layers upon layers of technologies and solutions.

---

## 🧱 From Systems to Ecosystems to Infrastructures

- **Infrastructure**:
  - A **shared resource** for a community/organization.
  - Not a tool, but a platform: e.g., electricity, telecom, railroads, Internet.
  - Built upon an **installed base**: evolves incrementally and is path-dependent.

- **Ecosystems**:
  - Exist **between hierarchy and markets**.
  - Mix of governance structures, forms and functions.

---

## 🏭 Digital Transformation of Industries

- **Airline Industry**: Booking systems (1950 s)
- **Banking**: SWIFT (1960 s), Vipps, shopping/payment platforms
- **Media, Advertising, Shipping**: All undergoing digital transition
- **Shift**: From organization-level change to industry-level transformation

---

## 📊 Example: Programmatic Advertising  
- Explosive growth of AdTech companies since early 2000 s.

## ⚙️ Socio-Technical Regime

> A regime is a rule-set embedded in technology, practices, institutions, and infrastructures.

- Involves:
  - Engineering practices
  - Product standards and processes
  - Institutional and social structures
- Used in **transition studies** (e.g., sailing → steam, carbon → renewables)

### Key Levels:
1. **Niche**
2. **Regime**
3. **Landscape**

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Architecture**
- **Governance structures**
- **Process models**: Agile, waterfall
- **Conway’s Law / Mirroring Hypothesis**:
  - System design mirrors organizational structure

---

## 🧭 Regime Strategy

- Strategies can be **deliberate or emergent**
- Especially relevant in complex infrastructures with many actors

### Example: Norwegian Health Sector
- Who sets strategy? How does it evolve? Who's in control?

## 🛠️ What is an Information Infrastructure?

> “A shared, evolving, open, standardized, and heterogeneous installed base.” – Hanseth  
> “Fractionally coherent object” – Grisot & Law

- Characterized by **multiplicities**:
  - Connected, layered, overlapping, criss-crossing infrastructures
  - Each regime adds to complexity

## 🧬 E-Health in Norway: Geology of Infrastructures

### Timeline of Dominant Regimes:

| Period       | Regime Characteristics |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **1970–1990** | Developer/user constellations, in-house innovation |
| **1990–2002** | Standardization committees, formal standards |
| **2002–2008** | Regional IT management, application standards |
| **2008–2012** | IT architects, service-oriented architecture (SOA), RBCWS |
| **2012–2019** | Top-down control, consolidation, “One citizen – one record” |
| **2019–Now**  | Ecosystem approach, post-Akson failures |

---

## 🧪 Evolution = Interaction of Regimes + Landscape

### Contributing Factors:
- Technological innovation: Mainframes → Cloud, IoT, Blockchain
- Medical innovation: Genetic tech, mRNA, etc.
- Organizational change
- Destabilization leads to **new regime emergence** and eventual (re) stabilization

---

## 🧾 Key Regime Transitions

### 🧩 Pre-1990:
- **Stand-alone apps**
- Developer/user-driven innovation
- Loosely coupled systems

### 🔁 1990–2002:
- **Destabilization**: Redundancy, inconsistency, rise of comm tech
- **Emergence**: Telenor, Fürst Lab, ISO standards
- **Stabilization**: Health Ministry + KITH-led standardization

### 📦 2002–2008:
- **Destabilization**: Hospital system nationalized
- **Emergence**: Regional IT management
- **Stabilization**: Governance (Y-model), framework contracts

### 🧱 2008–2012:
- **Destabilization**: National ICT coordination
- **Emergence**: IT architects propose SOA & RBCWS
- **Stabilization**: Projects launched in multiple regions

### 🏛️ 2012–2019:
- **Destabilization**: KA project failure
- **Emergence**: Centralized control via Parliament
- **Stabilization**: Digital Renewal program; Epic introduced

### 🌐 2019–Present:
- **Destabilization**: Epic fails, Akson scandal, outsourcing backlash
- **Emergence**: Move toward ecosystem model
- **Stabilization**: Ongoing, ecosystem logic replacing “big projects”

---

## 🔄 Regime Dynamics

- Destabilization introduces **new actors**.
- New actors bring **new perspectives**, reshaping the regime.
- **Events** act as triggers:
  - 1990: Telenor + ComTech → standardization
  - 2002: Govt takeover → regionalization
  - 2008: SOA/RBCWS proposal
  - 2012: Merge failure → centralization
  - 2019: Akson, outsourcing → ecosystems

---

## ⚒️ Installed Base Challenges

- **Each regime embeds future problems**:
  - >1990: Fragmentation
  - 1990–2002: Bureaucratic slowness
  - 2012–2019: Unmanageable complexity
- **Not deterministic**: Human agency and pragmatism still matter

## 📚 Key Concepts Summary

| Concept | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Shared, evolving technical base |
| **Regime** | Stable configuration of tech, practices, and actors |
| **Destabilization** | Disruption due to new tech, actors, events |
| **Installed Base** | Accumulated historical systems shaping present/future |
| **Ecosystem** | Decentralized, multi-actor collaboration model |

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

- Information infrastructures evolve **organically**—not just by design.
- Transitions happen through **interaction** between technologies, actors, and external events.
- A **socio-technical lens** is essential to understanding digital transformations.
- Today’s e-health infrastructures are shaped by a **long history of regimes**, and now lean toward **ecosystem-based models**.
