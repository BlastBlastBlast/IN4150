# Multisided Platforms – Lecture Notes  
**Lecturer: Raissa Pershina**

## 1. Introduction
- 5 of the 10 most valuable companies (2024) use a **platform model**.
- **Lecture topics:**
  - Platform definitions and types
  - Network effects
  - Key drivers:
    - Multihoming
    - Niche players
    - Entry barriers
    - Disintermediation

## 2. Definitions and Key Concepts

### What is a Platform?
- Platforms connect people/organizations, enabling new forms of interaction and innovation.
- Platforms = **Multisided ecosystems** (Cusumano et al., 2019).

### What is a “Side”?
- A distinct stakeholder group that the platform connects.
- Each side is a customer (e.g., providers and users).

**Examples:**
- **Facebook**: Users, advertisers, developers
- **Airbnb**: Hosts, guests
- **iOS**: Developers, end users
- **PlayStation/Xbox**: Gamers, developers
- **PayPal/Vipps**: Consumers, merchants

## 3. Are Platforms New?
- **No** – Examples from pre-digital age:
  - Shopping malls
  - Job fairs
  - Magazines
- **Digital tech** (e.g., mobile, cloud, broadband) supercharged platform growth.

**Note:** Not all digital businesses are multisided.
- **Netflix (original)**: one-sided (pipeline model)
- **YouTube**: multisided (creators, viewers, advertisers)

---

## 4. Platforms vs Traditional Businesses

### Key Differences
- Platforms often lack physical assets.
- Scale more efficiently.
- Can profit by subsidizing one side of the platform.

### Subsidy Side vs Money Side
- **Subsidy side**: receives free access or is paid
- **Money side**: charged enough to sustain platform

**Examples:**
- **Google**: Users (subsidy), Advertisers (money)
- **Finn. No**: Job seekers (subsidy), Employers (money)
- **Foodora**: Consumers (subsidy), Restaurants (money)

---

## 5. Platform Types (Applico)

### Transaction Platforms
- Facilitate **exchanges** between different user groups.
- E.g., Uber, Etsy, Airbnb, OpenTable

### Innovation Platforms
- Offer **technological infrastructure** for others to build upon.
- E.g., Android, iOS, Photoshop, game consoles

### Similarities
- Multisided structure
- Benefit from **network effects**
- Build **ecosystems** involving many participants

## 6. Network Effects
![[Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 16.25.50.png]]
### Direct (One-sided)
- Value increases with more users (e.g., telephone, social media)

### Indirect (Cross-sided)
- One group’s size increases value for another
  - E.g., more Uber drivers → better for passengers

### Critical Mass
- Self-sustaining growth point
- Important milestone for platform viability

### Negative Network Effects
- Overcrowding reduces value
  - E.g., Facebook clutter, bandwidth congestion

---

## 7. “Winner Takes All”? (Not Always)

- **First Mover → Network Effect → Market Dominance?**
  - Sometimes true, but not always

**Failed First Movers:**
- Friendster/MySpace → Facebook
- Netscape/IE → Chrome
- Symbian/BlackBerry → iOS/Android

### Key Insight:
- **Network effects** are not automatic
- Strategic decisions still crucial

---

## 8. Key Market Drivers

### A. Multihoming
- Users/providers use multiple platforms for same purpose.

**Reasons:**
- Promotions, functionality, social context

**Consequences:**
- Weakens network effects and slows growth

**How to reduce it:**
- Build ecosystems (e.g., Alibaba: Taobao, AliPay)
- Use proprietary standards (Apple)
- Loyalty programs (Uber, Expedia)
- Exclusive content or services

> *Reducing multihoming on one side may increase it on another.*

---

### B. Niche Players
- Specialize in specific markets or users
- Fragment network → reduce winner-takes-all likelihood
  - E.g., Upwork vs niche freelancing sites

---

### C. Disintermediation
- When users bypass the platform after connecting once.
  - E.g., hiring a tutor or cleaner directly instead of through the platform.

---

### D. Entry Barriers
- Obstacles for new entrants.
- **Types:**
  - Legal (patents)
  - Strategic (pricing, lock-in)
  - Technical (infrastructure)
  - Brand loyalty

> High barriers = protection from competition  
> Low barriers = increased competition

---

### E. Network Structure & Clustering
- Structure affects market dominance

**Examples:**
- **Uber**: Fragmented city clusters → easier to disrupt
- **Airbnb**: Global cluster → more defensible

## 9. Summary: What Drives Platform Success?

- Strength of **network effects**
- Difficulty of **multihoming**
- Degree of **niche competition**
- **Defensibility** of the network structure
- Risk of **disintermediation**
- Level of **entry barriers**

## Differences Between Multisided and Traditional (One-Sided/Pipeline) Businesses

![[Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 16.23.44.png]]
### 1. **Value Creation Model**
- **Traditional (Pipeline) Businesses:**
  - Value is created **linearly** through a controlled production and distribution chain.
  - The company creates the product/service and delivers it directly to the end user.

- **Multisided Platforms:**
  - Value is created by **facilitating interactions** between two or more independent groups (e.g., buyers and sellers).
  - The platform enables value exchange between users without producing the core product/service itself.

---

### 2. **Role of Users**
- **Traditional:** Users are typically **end consumers** only.
- **Multisided:** Users can be both **producers and consumers** (e.g., Airbnb hosts and guests, YouTube creators and viewers).

---

### 3. **Ownership of Assets**
- **Traditional:** Often **own or control** the key assets (e.g., inventory, production facilities).
- **Multisided:** Frequently **do not own** the assets involved in the value exchange (e.g., Uber doesn’t own cars, Airbnb doesn’t own property).

---

### 4. **Scaling and Growth**
- **Traditional:** Scaling usually requires **proportional increases** in production, staff, and logistics.
- **Multisided:** Can scale **rapidly and cheaply** through network effects as more users join.

---

### 5. **Revenue Models**
- **Traditional:** Revenue comes directly from **selling products/services** to customers.
- **Multisided:** Revenue often comes from **charging one side** of the platform, while **subsidizing the other** (e.g., free users, paid advertisers).

---

### 6. **Network Effects**
- **Traditional:** Rarely benefit from network effects.
- **Multisided:** **Heavily dependent** on both direct and indirect **network effects** to grow and sustain value.

---

### 7. **Customer Segmentation**
- **Traditional:** Usually deal with **a single customer segment**.
- **Multisided:** Must balance and serve **multiple interdependent customer groups**.

|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Value creation           | Linear                    | Interaction-based           |

| Customer base            | Single group              | Multiple, interdependent    |
