## 🌱 What is an Ecosystem?

> “An economic system consisting of non-hierarchical complementarities on the production side and non-generic complementarities on the consumption side.”  
— *Jacobides et al., 2018*

### Key Terms:
- **Economic system**: Value-producing market system (product/service)
- **Complementarity**: Components add more value **together** than separately

---

## 🧪 Complementarities

### Production Side:
- Heterogeneous resources, processes, and activities
- **Non-hierarchical** and **cospecialized** (Teece, 1986)
- Cross-organizational value creation

### Consumption Side:
- Offerings are **composable** and integrated by the **end user**
- Requires coordination among producers for value creation

---

## 🧭 What is Governance?

- **Governance**: How authority and control are structured
- Includes both formal and informal **rules and procedures**

### Governance = "Blueprint" for Management Structures

---

## 📚 Definitions

### Governance Structures (Klein et al., 2019)
- Rules for:
  - Who gets in/out
  - Resource allocation and development
  - Distribution and conflict resolution

### IT Governance (De Haes & Van Grembergen, 2004)
- Board-level responsibility
- Ensures IT supports strategic goals

### Management
- The act of organizing people/resources to achieve goals
- Encompasses planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling

## 🏢 Organizational vs. Network Governance

| Aspect                 | Organizational Governance          | Network Governance                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Structure              | Explicit hierarchy                 | Implicit relationships            |
| Boundaries             | Inside formal orgs                 | Across org boundaries             |
| Legal Framework        | Formal & regulated                 | Informal, relational              |
| Example                | Corporate departments              | Digital ecosystems                |

> Ecosystems = **networked organizations** → require **network governance**

---

## 🧱 Ecosystem Architecture

### Platforms as Complex Systems (Tiwana, 2013)

> A system of interdependent components that form a greater whole.

### Artifacts
- **Tangible**: Cars, planes, phones
- **Intangible**: Laws, strategies, orgs
- **Technology** = Knowledge used to make artifacts

---

## 🧩 Complex Artifacts = Formal Organizations

1. **Division of Knowledge**: Many people needed to understand the system
2. **Division of Labour**: Many people needed to build it

---

## 🏗️ Two Designs of Complex Systems

| Type                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Organizational Structure** | Who does the tasks (social structure) |
| **Technical Architecture**   | What the tasks are and how they connect (product structure) |

> Organizational structure **mirrors** technical architecture

---

## 🎛️ Architecture & Governance

### Technical Architecture
- Tasks, components, interfaces
- Driven by technology and problem-solving needs

### Organizational Structure
- People, roles, communication
- Realizes the technical blueprint
- Governance = how structure is managed

---

## 🧭 Span of Control

- Which parts of the technical architecture are **controlled internally**?
- Strategic decision:
  - What to build in-house?
  - What to outsource?
- Affects governance strategy

---

## 🧩 Governance Strategies

| Type                     | Focus                                           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Organizational Governance Strategy** | Internal control over components             |
| **Network Governance Strategy**       | Influence over **external** contributors     |

---

## ⚙️ Modularity vs. Monolithic Systems

### Modular Architecture
- Independent sub-systems (e.g., car parts)
- Interfaces for interaction
- Benefits:
  - Flexibility, innovation, agility
  - Specialization and recombination

### Monolithic Architecture
- One tightly integrated system
- Central control
- Benefits:
  - Less complexity
  - Faster decisions
  - High oversight

---

## 📈 Growth Logics

| System        | Growth Mechanism       | Span of Control        | Logic                      |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Modular**   | External, via networks | Less control           | Network effects            |
| **Monolithic**| Internal, via scaling  | More internal control  | Mass production            |

---

## 🧩 Platform Ecosystems

1. Are **modular** systems
2. Are governed by **network governance**
3. Are **designed systems** producing complex artifacts

> In practice, ecosystems exist on a **spectrum** between modular and monolithic.
